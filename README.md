# TODO
The following is an ongoing list of suggested revisions that need to be made to the website.

* Message needs to be displayed in trusstee table after all names have been removed
* Result table needs to be refreshed whenever a trustee is added or removed, otherwise a manual refresh is needed 
* Close ballot on reset
* Don't allow ballot to be opened if no trustees have been added
